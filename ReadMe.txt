This project is inspired by this video :

To run this file, just run the Runner class.

You can select a file , or you can type in a file's name. If you type in a file's name, it will assume you have this file under Hackthon parent file.

This project is unfinished because I run out of time. 

It works properly for only one file input. 
But if you have two different inputs, then it may produce bugs, and I didn't finish the selection for dice's faces. But I have a breif idea about that algorithm.
If I picked one face of the dice, then I can't select the opposite faces, in that cases, the corresponding pixel could have 4 gray-levels.

The Object of this project is to learn the pixels and drawing. Every dices is a pixel in this drawing, and we have 6 gray-levels. 
Hopefully it can help to learn the fundament of pixels.

Also, if we delve deeper into this problem, we can also check the remaining faces of these dices.
